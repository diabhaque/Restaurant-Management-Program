# Restaurant-Management-Program
Computer Programming 2 Course Code ENGG1340 Group 38 Project
We are planning to make a restaurant management system. 
It begins with setting up a specific restaurant. Which, according to user input, records the number of tables and the seating capacity of each table. We then set up a menu through input from a file that contains all info about the menu including prices. The menu will most likely be an array of structs called food which stores the food name, the food price and the waiting time on it. These inputs are assumed to be from the restaurant manager/owner. 

We then start a loop that runs the actual code. 
We then allow customers to book a table. 
They input the number of seats they need. And we assign them a suitable table.
We start a seperate process for each customer.
We then take orders from that table for each person and store all this data in a class object or a struct. 
They wait for the food
The finish eating
Once process end, the table is free again.
